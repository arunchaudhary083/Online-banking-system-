JDBC MySQL Project with DAO Pattern
This project demonstrates how to connect to a MySQL database using JDBC and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It follows the DAO (Data Access Object) design pattern for better maintainability and scalability. The project also includes proper exception handling, logging using SLF4J with Logback, and transaction management.

Features
JDBC Database Connectivity: Establishes a connection to a MySQL database using JDBC.
DAO Pattern: Implements the DAO design pattern for managing database operations.
CRUD Operations: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for a User entity.
Custom Exception Handling: Custom exceptions (DatabaseException) for better error management.
Logging: Utilizes SLF4J and Logback for logging operations and errors.
Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

JDK 8 or higher
MySQL Database (Local or Remote)
Maven for project dependency management
SLF4J & Logback for logging
Database Setup
Install MySQL (if not already installed).

Create a database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE projectdb;
USE projectdb;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
Configure Database Connection: Update the src/main/resources/db.properties file with your database credentials:

properties
Copy code
db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/projectdb
db.username=root
db.password=rootpassword
Project Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/arunchaudhary083/Online-banking-system/jdbc-mysql-dao.git
cd jdbc-mysql-dao
2. Build the Project
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
This will download the necessary dependencies and build the project.

3. Run the Application
You can run the project directly from your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or from the command line:

bash
Copy code
java -cp target/your-jar-file.jar com.yourpackage.Main
4. Logging
The project uses SLF4J and Logback for logging. By default, logs will be printed to the console. You can modify the logging configuration by editing the logback.xml file (if necessary).

CRUD Operations
The Main.java class demonstrates the following operations:

Create: Adds a new user to the database.
Read: Fetches all users from the database.
Update: Updates an existing user's details.
Delete: Deletes a user from the database by ID.
Example Output
bash
Copy code
User added successfully: User{id=1, name='John Doe', email='john.doe@example.com'}
Users: [User{id=1, name='John Doe', email='john.doe@example.com'}]
User updated successfully: User{id=1, name='John Updated', email='john.doe@example.com'}
User deleted successfully: ID 1
Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
Connection Issues: Ensure the MySQL database is running and the credentials in db.properties are correct.
SQLException: Double-check the database schema to ensure the users table matches the model.
